## Why?
There are often times I want to watch a movie from my bed, on my PC. 

## How it works:
- A broker server is used to establish WebRTC connections between the interface and the Netflix window. 
- The server only stores the initial WebRTC signalling data for the netflix window. All subsequent communication is done with a WebRTC connection.

## Caveats:
- The connection will be broken if either of the pages, the netflix window or the interface are reloaded. You would need to establish a new connection.
- There may be debug messages in the extension, in the console, ignore them. I've removed those in the 1.1 version now.
